# mariadb-sqla-docker-setup
A simple MariaDB database setup using SQLAlchemy and Docker

---

This is a WIP project created as a learning experience for integrating SQLAlchemy to MySQL databases within Docker containers.

While this is still being developed, there are a few setup examples for connecting SQLAlchemy to containerized databases, with basic schema manipulation, in the `./setup_examples` directory. A more detailed README on them is available at the same folder.
